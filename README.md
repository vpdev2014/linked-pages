This Chrome extension, named "Linked Pages", is designed to help users manage and navigate between interrelated web pages. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to save links to pages that are related to the current page they are viewing.

The extension operates through a popup window that displays a list of saved links for the current page. Each link is displayed with a delete button, allowing users to easily remove any link they no longer need. The delete button is hidden by default and only appears when the user hovers over the link, keeping the interface clean and uncluttered.

Users can add a new link by entering it into a text input field and clicking the "+" button. The new link is then added to the list of links for the current page. If the user tries to add a link that is already in the list, the extension will prevent the duplication.

The extension also provides error handling. If an error occurs while adding or deleting a link, the error will be logged to the console.

The extension is built with JavaScript and uses the Chrome Extension API to interact with the browser. It also uses CSS for styling the popup window and the elements within it.

The code for the extension is organized into modules, each responsible for a specific part of the functionality. The `background.js` module handles the core functionality of saving, retrieving, and deleting links. The `popup.js` module handles the user interface in the popup window. The `constants.js` and `chrome.js` modules provide utility functions and constants used throughout the extension.

Overall, "Linked Pages" is a handy tool for anyone who frequently works with sets of related web pages, making it easier to navigate between them and keep track of important links.
